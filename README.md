HOW TO USE APP after downloading zip
=======================================

1. extract zip into UserProgramFiles
2. copy the file "chromedriver.exe" which can be found in the main directory of this repository 
   into \wellbeingPage\bin\Debug (you may need to build the app using VS first)
3. run the wellbeingpage.exe (obviously if we were to distribute the app then we would just rename the exe to Bumblebee.exe and share that)
